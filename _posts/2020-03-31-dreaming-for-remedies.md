Bury the days. Bury the days, for now, in time. Every day feels so alike here. Though I see no one, I still fear that they will see me. Even my neighbors can glimpse my face above the backyard gate. The clouds cast over the wires, the patterns puff above my head. Overtones of grey bleed across each other, the lines of my hands. The breath I inhale in this cold air is the bluest, and I exhale it. The wind clips my diaphragm; a calico cloth slides across my stomach. This is the possible air, cold. It is safe for now.

The mask will not protect me. That’s what many say. Some sources say that it is better than nothing, but its effectiveness varies. It can at least prevent others from catching the disease from me. I do not have the virus, I don’t think. 

Deborah Birx, an official on the White House coronavirus task force, says that a significant number of millennials in France and Italy have been reported as serious cases. Birx suggests that millennials may have taken fewer precautions against contracting the illness than other groups. She acknowledges that the numbers may have come from increased exposure, and not necessarily from an increased likelihood that millennials will suffer serious illness. The spring breakers and St. Patrick’s day goers expose themselves on social media with brazen fervor, proclaiming they can never be stopped. Are they speaking to the virus? I wonder from where their commitment stems, from what sources of distress do they struggle to a place of bliss, denial, annihilation in party.

The virus is transmitted by saliva, which travels up to six feet past one’s lips. It lives on surfaces in tiny droplets. The material composition of those surfaces determines how long it will survive. It can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours, plastic up to three days. It will die, alone, if not touched by a potential host. Some say, however, that the virus can live in even tinier aerosols. In a single cough, it can survive in the air for up to three hours, though experts do not know if this is enough to infect others. If airborne infection were likely though, the general rate of contagion would already appear much higher than it is now. Airborne contagion is indeed more likely in hospital environments, during procedures such as intubation. 

Sylvia Browne predicted this pandemic in her 2008 book End of Days: “In around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments. Almost more baffling than the illness itself will be the fact that it will suddenly vanish as quickly as it arrived, attack again ten years later, and then disappear completely.” I’ll wait to see when the disease will depart spontaneously. And then onward to 2030 where we will meet it again. We might even be prepared by then. Or we might be closer to the end of apocalypse, with the wealthiest government in the world structured on denying the homeless housing in vacant homes even amid orders to shelter in place (advocates call for housing, not shelters), or denying the incarcerated access to hand sanitizer while it demands them to bottle it for slave wages.
 
Even days after the President signed an executive order to invoke the Defense Production Act, he called not a single order for factories to produce masks, respirators, gowns, for fear that the economy would become socialist, and he would bear responsibility for mismanagement. As though he won’t bear the shame of mismanagement now. State officials compete and overpay for the same equipment from private manufacturers. Mismanagement, failure, disaster. It bears many names and faces. Apocalypse has already come upon us. With the precedent set forth by this administration, though its dealings are not new to those who account the government as the withholder of rights and the heart of malfeasance, I’m not sure we will rise from apocalypse by the time Sylvia Browne predicts the second occurrence of this pandemic. 

Maybe living the present as such allows us to deny our crisis condition. Apocalypse may only be a word for the future tense. But the challenge is not to accept the current time as an apocalypse per se, for in that we resign to face our end. A better way to meet this moment is to recall what excites us most. An unceasing transformation. The blood of the world mutates. People die at no fault of their own and their blood is drained through the ground. Nothing can be the way it was before. A tragedy which begets rebirth requires creative furor, the blasting of dead habits to revisit the child within. Feed, play, witness. Uncover the mysteries. Bury the days in time, and the ground is ours from which to invent ways to live.

Having returned to walls and ceilings, I no longer see the sky. No more time in the old yard. I am here, thoroughly, though where do I go in the house? The house, the borders of this place, have caught up to me. I sit here for hours reflecting on what could be and what could have been, without realizing that I am already acting.

Shutter the days. The stairs arise in patches. I see in visions still. Carry the dreams far away. That is how we remember dreams. We forget them. Even the brightest scenes edged in black. 

For now. The brilliant colors will return.

My friend tells me she’s reading Confessions of a Mask by Yukio Mishima. Another friend believes this must be a joke about the masks. I hadn’t thought of it. The first friend was reading it in earnest, recommending it to me as an evocative work of homoeroticism. A boy suppresses his desire for men. He marries a woman. A picture of a shirtless, muscular Mishima graces the cover. He holds a sword with both hands. The sword stands vertical, a mirror of his stance. He is calm, but he is prepared to come forward. He is on the verge of lunging the blade. He comes. He slashes a white cloth. 

In his memoir Sun and Steel, Yukio Mishima laments the abstract function of words, which “had the effect of being a barrier to everything else.” In a venture to strengthen his muscles in an interdependence with steel, for bodies need objects to bear their strength and vice versa, he aims to “reach the ‘ultimate sensation’ that lies just a hairsbreadth beyond the reach of the senses.” As intellectuals dwell in imagination, they “[come] into contact only with shadows and lose the courage to make themselves at home with the tribulations of their own flesh.”

Mishima planned his ritual suicide for a year before committing the act in his 1970 coup attempt at the Ichigaya military camp in Tokyo. He sought the attention of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, to overturn the 1947 Constitution and restore the authority of the emperor, whom he believed to be the essence of Japan. The coup itself, according to his biographer John Nathan, was the platform by which Mishima would commit his long-premeditated seppuku. After three failed attempts by his second-in-command, Masakatsu Morita, he was beheaded, finally, by his third, Hiroyasu Koga. His innards, slashed from his abdomen, lay on the ground. His head bowed down hanging by a filet of his neck, the traditional posture of embrace. A rapid death by blood loss.

The gash cascades a dark red water. A slit, slide the finger alongside. Perhaps his masculinity is the spectre. A mask is itself a vulnerability, not a protection. The confessions are pressure points. Prod. The man himself appears as the cover, the surface, the shine.

Hook the spine of the book from the opened page and drag the paper down. The edges come apart. They fray like a fire frozen in time. That was a diary.

I woke up on the porch of a tavern. I had fallen, my head recently coming out of a pain. The night lacquered purple on all untouched by light. The moon, high and white, singly assured my aliveness. A circle. Was it staring at me? Mocking me? It could be so perfect. 

I don’t remember how I came here. The only other light came from the open-air window, an ochre square. I walked through the batwing doors. I wore cowboy boots, and so did everyone else. 

Who comes here?

“Only those who know come through those doors,” said Molly the bartender. She wore a ten-gallon hat with a brim that covered her eyes. Her face was flushed pink. She had that permanently sick look, a face that is rewarmed after long exposure to cold winds. There is no winter here, but there is windburn from the sands. I could have fallen in love with her that instant.

Who holds the secrets here?

A man named Gabriel slid along the counter. “You’re here, after so long.” He was an angel. Like the angel Gabriel: the messenger, the interpreter. He read to me part of the SACRED POETRY section of Theresa Hak Kyung Cha’s Dictee, POLYMNIA. 

The young woman asked her what she was doing so far away from home. The child answered simply that she was on her way home from the neighboring village to take back remedies for her mother who was very ill. She had been walking from daybreak and although she did not want to stop, she was very tired and thirsty, so she had come to the well.

The woman listened and when the child finished her story, she nodded and gently patted the child’s head. She then brought over a basket and sat down beside her. The basket was filled with many pockets and she began to bring out one by one each pocket drawn with a black string. She said that these were special remedies for her mother and that she was to take them to her. She gave her instructions on how to prepare them.

She took off the kerchief that she wore and placed it on her lap. She took the bowl and said she must serve the medicines inside the bowl. After she had completed her instructions, she was to keep the tenth pocket and the bowl for herself as a gift from her. She placed the white bowl in the center of the white cloth. The light renders each whiteness iridescent, encircling the bowl a purple hue.

Polymnia is the muse of sacred poetry, hymn, dance, and eloquence. She is the serious, pensive one. I picture her as the one who studies the traditions of peoples as they sing to their gods. She asks, for what do they sing? Why do they chant, why do they hum? She asks because she agrees. Humans are so collective in their efforts to reach something they do not know. God across peoples is not a person, but the essence of love. Love, strange and abstract yet completely striking and whole, leaves one brandishing for existence.

Molly, what do you know? Molly knew everything, because she observed every person who walked through that door.

Love, Molly, do you know anything about love?

I know something. Love is the only thing people want. All roads lead to it. I guess love gives people a reason.

She hid her eyes under the big hat’s brim. She had seen everyone walk through that door. The tattered visions of every person haunted her. The sound of boots clattering on the floor, glasses clinking and shattering amid smoke. Dust, on a clear night like this. 

The dust haze lingers between earth and sky. The landscape exists inside the opaque screen. On the other side of it and beyond.

The moon sings on its own, Gabriel said. We walked out together to see the light. Molly came behind us. 

It’s like an eye, isn’t it? 

Let’s move away from the clamor. 

I had known Gabriel for a long time. He dwelled in my dreams. I found him in those rare moments in between scenes of voluble characters and imminent violence. The memory of an orange room filled with steam. Something about his back. His smooth, gray back and the line between his shoulder blades. He had a look that I could not steer away from. Blond, curly hair. The darkest brown eyes. Had we known each other from elsewhere? His origins I could not remember. I feared to show him my face. Despite my barriers, he remained close to me. He lived in the adobe homes of this desert, though he had moved here some time ago. He saw me when I looked at him, even if he did not look back. I’m not sure how he felt, but he remained close to me.

Out in the dunes we sat together. Molly installed a fire. We closed our eyes. After minutes of the flame crushing the wood into cracks and ashes, a figure in a long skirt appeared. I could not make out its face, for it was always obscured by something. The light, perhaps. The darkness. Some screen of this vision. It danced around us. It shuffled between our bodies, its grey arms caressing the fire. Its garments brushed against our sitting bodies. I feared its presence. I could tell that it stared at me, though I could not stare back. I winced between watching it shift among us and shutting my eyes, wishing that it would leave. Finally I let go of my desire, and I sat in waiting as Gabriel and Molly did.

It muttered a word. 

What did it say?

She began walking very rapidly. Her steps seemed to move lighter than before. After a while she turned around to wave to the young woman at the well. She had already left the well. She turned and looked in all directions but she was not anywhere to be seen. She remembered her words about stopping on her way and she started to run.

It had gone. Did I see it jump into the fire? Or had the fire swallowed it? I believe in spirits, although I don’t see God. I feel God in vessels, a strategy of blood. Warm, waning winds. Spirits, I don’t know where they come from. Some unanswered cry in a memory, in a life no longer embodied. Calling after what could not face it in its flesh. Sickly, it leaves its body. The question seeks a container again, or else it dissipates into the air and returns when the dust can no longer hold it. I felt that I was in that spirit, my silent outpouring, my soul pooled somewhere in its misshapen face. The part that I could not see.

Molly said, in a whisper, was it screaming?

Our flesh moved slowly as we wandered in our minds. Screen. The visions altered, slanting the tiny hairs of our limbs. We looked up. Was it the wind?

“Those blue skies, though, were unusual skies such as I might never see again in my life: one moment strung up high aloft, the next plunged to the depths; constantly shifting, a strange compound of lucidity and madness.”

I have drunk wine for several nights now. I keep returning to the evolving channels, news, videos, images, to see the world in my sedate position. I wish to dream in life, to daydream. To live among the black edges, vignettes like memories already recounted. The wine, red, teaches me what my body wants. To lie down and hold onto my surroundings. My clothes, my bed, my blanket. Like lovers they are. Surfaces. Surrender. I am beholden to touch, when I should feel. What are the things that reach my body?

I am afraid. I feel pains in my face, my chest, my back. I fear to show the world my face. It is the classic story, the one I tell over and over. A mask is a vulnerability, not a protection. I shield my face in the screen. 

I am not my face. I repeat it. I carry it. The mask.

I can’t afford to daydream alone, reading books without focus, streaming phrases that strike me into oblivion. I see the words without understanding their meaning. I daydream the worries, reminded by the words, their associations, their blurred meanings as Carole would have them. I wish to run off farther into the world, from this cavern, this collection of hard and soft cells, this grid of wood and brick. The comfort, the safety, the forlornness and desperation of it. These days have grayed over with every passage. Where will my next lead me? Sounds, images, rivers, stones. Music, patterns, the rip, the blur. A falling nest, a breaking machine. A routine comes off the body. I hope to hear hymns.
