1: The willful child, hole of light

February 2/February 29, 2020


From the Brothers Grimm, Household Tales, trans. Margaret Hunt:

Once upon a time there was a child who was wilful, and would not do what her mother wished. For this reason God had no pleasure in her, and let her become ill, and no doctor could do her any good, and in a short time she lay on her death-bed. When she had been lowered into her grave, and the earth was spread over her, all at once her arm came out again, and stretched upwards, and when they had put it in and spread fresh earth over it, it was all to no purpose, for the arm always came out again. Then the mother herself was obliged to go to the grave, and strike the arm with a rod, and when she had done that, it was drawn in, and then at last the child had rest beneath the ground.

When I ask myself why can’t I be pretty, who do I ask? Do I call God? If it’s a rhetorical question, I should actually say: “I am not pretty.” By that, I accept my truth, rather than denying it out of fear. On the surface it’s a frivolous question. But it bothers me constantly. I must face it somehow. As Tara Brach says, with compassion. If I suppress it, it will resurface. If I hit it with a rod, as the story goes, do I hit it because I love it to the point where I know it must die? Or because I refuse to know what a future with it will hold? Again, who and why am I asking?

I should ask unanswerable questions. They help me know further without the impression that I know all. Where does the mother derive the rod? By what law or moral is she obliged? In Ligia Lewis’s Water Will (in Melody), which I witnessed last night, the four women yell as they mime in a line of broken crucifixes, “I’m stuck!” They repeat. Their faces deform under strobe lights. Their bodies seize.

The piece begins with the white bunny girl, who relates the story in minimal upcast light. Her skeleton makes whimsical gestures. Her arms respond by momentum to the will of other parts, namely her head, torso, and legs. All moving parts sit in their weight; all responding parts dangle, appendages they become. Her face contorts as she blurts “sugar pie honey bun” in between lines. Towards the end of Part 1, she falls backwards as she holds one hand on her pelvis and the other slaps it in a steady rhythm. She stares at the audience from far away.

One, the one who recites her first speech in German, who wears the dress which keeps riding up, says “I fall” and delivers a monologue with high-heeled foot in the air, cut in the middle by a high scream. In Part 2, the dress comes over her bare butt. She drops to the ground, exposed. I immediately conjure up the image of a victim. 

The stage goes dark after ecstasy in Part 1, and the woman who first appears to us as a mime, the woman with the nylon sleeves, falls off stage. As the white bunny and the woman with the dress speak intermittently, the mime woman smears her nylon sleeves along the floor as she hides into the right side curtain. The crackling scatters across the stage. The mime woman returns when the white light emerges, lying like a spider in a birthing position.

The character played by Ligia Lewis ends Part 1 by falling through the closed curtain. Strobe lights hit the audience. A single hole of light follows. It loops around us. When the light lands on an audience member, the one with glasses and a septum piercing, Ligia comes back to motion. She drags her body off the stage while trying to explain darkness. The moment she utters “precarity” her hand comes up against her face and enters her mouth, brushing against the microphone to amplify the sound of rubbing foam. The words “WHITEY HAS TO DIE” reappear at the back of the stage, from the sliding text which lay throughout Part 1. The words disappear within a second. She falls to the stage and Part 2 begins.

Fog falls from above in Part 2. Pools of droplets lace the ground. The four women slip about barefoot. They no longer wear oxfords and lace. A yellow rectangle of light rotates and swells as they move in reflection on the first part’s trauma. They crumble together in a pyramid of four bodies. They sigh. They laugh. The mime woman with the sleeves breaks them apart. Part 2 is shorter than Part 1.

Does the mother forge the rod? What control does she desire over her child’s body, in the first place? Speculation has no place in reading, I can guess. The mother comes from all possible intentions. She is an axis of God. She is will herself. Water Will (in Melody) does not interpret the willful child. It responds in all directions.

Do I want to be the mother as much as I want to be the resistant victim to her act? Once God decides his pleasure, only one subject comes out the most determined.

I pose a question to the ether. To whom do I ask questions but to God or myself? My mind speaks to hope for an answer. Hole of light on my forehead. I wish to find God to know how to deal with all the sad news. How hard is it to love myself when acts of hatred fill the media? How many people die by malice, in the local and national news, that we ask how much a murderer has to hate themselves? That we see in the thousands of lives overcome by a virus how people establish their fear on racism, even if they themselves do not kill. God won’t come to me for me to find him. I will probably fail to discover him somewhere beyond myself. When I get to God, the rod will put me down from wherever it comes.
